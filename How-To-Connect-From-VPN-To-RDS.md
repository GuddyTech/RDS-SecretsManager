# ‚úÖ Checklist to Connect from VPN-Connected Laptop to RDS
1. RDS is in a private subnet (‚úÖ okay ‚Äî as long as VPN can reach it)
2. Your laptop IP (via VPN) is allowed in the RDS security group
  - The RDS security group must allow inbound MySQL (port 3306) from your VPN client IP range
Example:
```
Type: MySQL/Aurora
Port Range: 3306
Source: 10.0.0.0/16  ‚Üê your VPN CIDR block
```
3. No network ACLs or firewalls are blocking it
4. You're using the correct endpoint and credentials:
  - RDS endpoint (private DNS)
  - Port: `3306`
  - DB name: `appdb`
  - Username: `myapp_user`
  - Password: `YourStrongPassword123!`

# üîç How to Test Connectivity
Run from your laptop (with VPN on):
```
telnet <rds-endpoint> 3306
```
or
```
nc -vz <rds-endpoint> 3306
```
If it says "Connected" or "Open", you're good.
If it hangs or fails, it‚Äôs likely a security group or routing issue.

# Step-by-Step: Allow VPN Access to RDS (MySQL)
1. Find your RDS security group
  - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí RDS ‚Üí Databases
  - Click your RDS instance
  - In the Connectivity & security section, look for VPC security groups
  - Click the security group link ‚Äî it will open in the EC2 console
2. Get your VPN client IP range (CIDR)
  - If you know the CIDR block used for VPN-connected devices (e.g., 10.10.0.0/16), use that
  - If you're unsure, while connected to the VPN, run this on your laptop:
    ```
    ipconfig         # on Windows
    ifconfig         # on macOS/Linux
    ```
    Look for an IP like `10.x.x.x` or `172.x.x.x.` That helps narrow the subnet range.
3. Update Inbound Rules
  - In the security group screen, click Edit inbound rules
  - Add a new rule:
    ```
    Type:          MySQL/Aurora
    Protocol:      TCP
    Port Range:    3306
    Source:        Custom
    CIDR/IP:       <your VPN CIDR block>   (e.g., 10.10.0.0/16)
    ```
# üîÅ Now test the connection
From your laptop:
```
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u myapp_user -p appdb
```
If it fails, try:
```
If it fails, try:
